ko-data-todo
============

An example ToDo app for ko-data.

To run it:

1. Install node.
1. `npm install`
1. `node server-main.js`

Then navigate to localhost:8081 and start poking around. This application uses polling to make realtime collaboration possible - open up two browsers and point them both at the app, and see how changes are synced up in real time.
